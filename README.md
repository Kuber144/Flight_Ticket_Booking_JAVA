# Flight_Ticket_Booking_JAVA
This project is also similar to the Flight Ticket Booking system using Python and MySQL but instead uses JAVA and also has added functionality of pre-ordering drinks and/or food through the platform.
It has the same functionality of booking flights (oneway or round), having discount facility and uses random function to call flights to increase the usability of the program.
The input is taken using scanner function and uses various JAVA functions to accomplish its purpose.

# Flight_Ticket_Booking_JAVA
This project is also similar to the Flight Ticket Booking system using Python and MySQL but instead uses JAVA and also has added functionality of pre-ordering drinks and/or food through the platform.
It has the same functionality of booking flights (oneway or round), having discount facility and uses random function to call flights to increase the usability of the program.
The input is taken using scanner function and uses various JAVA functions to accomplish its purpose.

The use of global variables and different functions is used to print,take input and do some other functions.
The program first takes information from the user on what type of flight they want and their personal details (added a small chance that the program will exit by saying that no flights are currently availabale by using random function).
Here the user is also asked to enter the code for availing the discount the logic for which is that the sum of the digits of the code should be divisible by 10.

Then the flights are displayed in the form of a table where the table is chosen based on random function and choosing one of the four tables to display.
The user enters the corresponding serial number to the flight.
After choosing the corresponding flights, the user is shown a list of snacks that they can preorder for their flight.
After choosing the snacks, the user needs to confirm wether they want to book their flight or not.
After confirmation the user is shown all of the details of their flight and then the program is exited.

Although the program does not store values it is an easy code to understand and provided me with the necessary steps to start my career in programming.
